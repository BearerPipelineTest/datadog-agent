# Each section from every release note are combined when the
# CHANGELOG.rst is rendered. So the text needs to be worded so that
# it does not depend on any information only available in another
# section. This may mean repeating some details, but each section
# must be readable independently of the other.
#
# Each section note must be formatted as reStructuredText.

    AppSec: obfuscate security events. It is enabled by default so that it obfuscates
    every security event value and highlights those with keys that match the regular expression
    `(?i)(p(ass)?w(((or)?d))|(phrase))|(secret)|(authorization)|(api_?key)|((access_?)?token)`.
    It can be further configured using the environment variables
    `DD_APPSEC_OBFUSCATION_PARAMETER_KEY_REGEXP` for the security event parameter key matching,
    and `DD_APPSEC_OBFUSCATION_PARAMETER_VALUE_REGEXP` for the security event parameter value
    and highlight matching.
